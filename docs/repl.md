# REPL utility

The SDK provides `run_demo_loop` for quick, interactive testing of an agent's behavior directly in your terminal.


```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, run_demo_loop

async def main() -> None:
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")
    await run_demo_loop(agent)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

`run_demo_loop` prompts for user input in a loop, keeping the conversation history between turns. By default, it streams model output as it is produced. When you run the example above, run_demo_loop starts an interactive chat session. It continuously asks for your input, remembers the entire conversation history between turns (so your agent knows what's been discussed) and automatically streams the agent's responses to you in real-time as they are generated.

To end this chat session, simply type `quit` or `exit` (and press Enter) or use the `Ctrl-D` keyboardÂ shortcut.


## Few-shot initialization with preload_history

The run_demo_loop function also accepts an optional preload_history parameter. This allows you to initialize the session with example user/assistant turns, providing context before interactive input begins.  


```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, run_demo_loop

async def main() -> None:
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")
    preload_history = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's 2+2?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "2+2 equals 4."}
    ]
    await run_demo_loop(agent, preload_history=preload_history)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```  

When you run this example, the chat session starts with the provided conversation history, and the agent can continue the dialogue as if those exchanges had already occurred.
